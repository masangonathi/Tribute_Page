            <li><span class="bold">1990 - </span> Hamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">1993 - </span> Hamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.
                Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. 
                That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: "Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">2001 - </span> Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.
                This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.
                He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">2004 - </span> He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.
                He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">2004 - </span> Hamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone. Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds.
                He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.After the season British magazine Autosport featured him in their "Top 50 Drivers of 2005" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">2008 - </span> Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth position in the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history 
                and to deny race-winner Massa the title by one point. This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.
